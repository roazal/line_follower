# Explanation of Project  
this project is a robot that moves on a brown line and stops at certain station. I wanted to put in this robot the ability to avoid obstacles 
by taking a quik action so that if it is working in a factory it does not harm the workers or cause problems. i also put the arm robot so that when 
it stops at the station it can carry and load things, but there was not enough time.
